##How-To

1. Clone this repo. git clone https://github.com/markhalonen/graphMyCommute
1. Hardest step. Get a google maps api so you can request the travel time. Follow the steps in their [repo](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python)
2. Make a file key.txt a level up from the cloned repo and store your api key there.
3. Similarly, make homeAddress.txt and workAddress.txt in the parent directory.
4. Make new charts and send me a pull request!
